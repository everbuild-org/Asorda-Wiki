## Welcome
The Tradehub acts like a lobby where you can trade with other players, swap items or simply chat. It is the central place for everything to do with trading. Whether you're looking for rare items, want to get rid of resources or just want to see what others are offering - there's always something going on here.
You can make deals directly with players or browse through offers in the auction house. Some also set up stores where you can stock up on useful items. You'll also often bump into familiar faces or meet new people - perfect for striking up a conversation or just hanging out.

In short: If you want to trade, come to Tradehub.
